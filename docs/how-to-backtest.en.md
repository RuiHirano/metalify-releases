> Many discretionary traders probably conduct backtests with the following procedure. We also recommend following this procedure when using the Metalify app.

1. Operate the player button to **stop chart progression.**
2. Analyze the chart, and if placing an order, use the order panel to place the order. If necessary, you can also **drag the price setting line on the MT4 chart** to adjust the order price.
3. When you confirm the order in the order panel, the order information will be displayed on the chart.
4. **Progress the chart at an appropriate speed** until closing, trailing and closing positions.
