# Change Speed

Appropriately adjusting the chart progression speed during backtesting is important for efficient testing. By using the player section of the Metalify app's control panel, you can easily perform operations such as changing speed and pausing. This guide explains in detail the specific operation methods.

## Stop and Resume

1. **Stop Button**: A button to pause the backtest progression. Clicking it will immediately stop progression.
2. **Resume Button**: A button to resume the stopped backtest progression. Clicking it will resume progression.

> [!CAUTION]
> The MT4 Strategy Tester section also has play/pause buttons, but using them will prevent placing new orders while stopped. Therefore, **we recommend always keeping the Strategy Tester's play/pause button on play and controlling with the Metalify app's player play/pause button.**

## Speed Adjustment

The player section of the control panel has speed adjustment buttons. You can adjust the speed with the following steps:

1. Speed adjustment button: Use this to adjust the progression speed in 5 levels between 0.2 and 1.0.
2. When approaching an entry timing, you can set the speed to slow to check detailed movements.
3. When it's not an entry timing or you want to quickly skip a specific time period, you can set the speed high.

This allows you to accurately check entry and exit timings, and efficiently conduct backtests by progressing through unnecessary time periods at high speed.

By mastering speed adjustment, you can conduct more efficient and accurate backtests. Try to proceed with tests at appropriate speeds according to each timing and situation.
