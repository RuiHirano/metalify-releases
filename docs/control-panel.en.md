## Player

The player allows you to adjust the backtest progression speed, pause and resume progression. The speed can be adjusted in 5 levels from 0.2 to 1.0. Using the Strategy Tester's stop button prevents placing orders while stopped, so using the player's stop button is recommended.

For detailed procedures, please refer to [**Change Speed**](/docs/player).

For detailed procedures, please refer to [**Placing Orders**](/docs/order).
