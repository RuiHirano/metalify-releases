### **4. Convenient Feature**: Directly Adjust Order Prices, Stop Loss, and Take Profit on MT4 Chart

1. Stop the chart from the player button when placing an order.
2. Turn on the stop loss and take profit checkboxes in the order panel.
3. In that state, click on the MT4 visual chart to select the horizontal line object.
4. Drag the horizontal line and move it to the required price.
5. Press and hold the horizontal line to confirm, and it will be reflected in the order panel.
